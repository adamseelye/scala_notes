- What is Git?
Git is a mature, actively maintained open source project originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux operating system kernel.
- What about GitHub? How are they related?
https://github.com/
- What command moves changes from GitHub to our local repo?
	git pull

- What command moves changes from our local repo to GitHub?
	git push

- What two commands are used in sequence to save changes to our local repo?
	git commit
	git push

- What is the JDK and what does it let us do?
	JDK stands for Java Development Kit and it is a software environment that
	enables development of Java software applications.

- What is the JRE and what does it let us do?
	JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment and it is a software layer
	running on top of the computer's OS, similar in a way to a virtual machine.
	The JRE provides the libraries required to run Java applications.

- What's the name for the code written in .class files?
	Bytecode. .CLASS files are generated by compiling Java source code files,
	and then these files are loaded into the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) at
	runtime to execute the application.

- How does Scala relate to Java?
	Scala inherits Java's object-oriented model and builds upon it. It may
	be almost be thought of as a Java library instead of a separate language,
	but there are key differences between the two that manifest as different
	strengths and weaknesses in different situations. For instance, a Scala
	variable is immutable by default, while Java variables are not.

- What is sbt (high level)?
	sbt is a source building tool created specifically for Scala. sbt builds
	a "build.sbt" file which contains information on the project directory
	structure (which has to be specific: src/main/scala) as well as information
	on the name of the Scala file(s) to run, the version, and the Scala
	version of the environment. sbt downloads any additional sources that are
	required and also builds out other source files to be used for the project.
	As soon as building is finished, the Scala program may be run.

- How does Scala relate to the JRE and JVM?
	Scala runs in the JRE on the JVM, just as Java does. Java and Scala code
	may even be run concurrently in the same JVM instance.

- Is Scala statically or dynamically typed?
	Scala is statically typed.

- Do we need to declare type for our variables in Scala? always?
	No, though there are instances when declaring a type may be desirable
	for readability of code.

- How do we define an auxiliary constructor?
- What is a REPL?
- How does the Scala REPL store the results of evaluated expressions?
- What is a higher order function?
- Why might we want to write an application using pure functions instead of impure functions?
- Why might we want mutable state (OOP) in our application?  Why might we want immutable state (FP)?
